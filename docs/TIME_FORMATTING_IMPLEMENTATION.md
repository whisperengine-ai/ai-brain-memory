# Time Formatting Enhancement

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date**: 2025-10-24  
**Effort**: ~30 minutes  
**Phase**: 2 (Target: 8.5/10 → 9.0/10)

## Overview
Replaced ISO timestamp display with human-readable "time ago" formatting in memory context prompts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Time Formatting Helper
Added `_format_time_ago()` method to three files:
- `ai_brain/inference.py` - For inference mode
- `ai_brain/cli.py` - For CLI memory display
- `ai_brain/langchain_brain.py` - For LangChain mode

### 2. Implementation Details

**Function Signature**:
```python
def _format_time_ago(self, timestamp: str) -> str:
    """
    Format timestamp as human-readable 'time ago' string.
    
    Args:
        timestamp: ISO format timestamp string
        
    Returns:
        Human-readable time string like "2 hours ago" or "3 days ago"
    """
```

**Logic**:
- `< 60 seconds` → "just now"
- `60s - 1 hour` → "X minutes ago"
- `1 - 24 hours` → "X hours ago"
- `≥ 24 hours` → "X days ago"
- Handles errors gracefully → "recently"

### 3. Updated Memory Display

**Before**:
```
1. [0.42] I want to share that I got a new cat today! (from 2025-10-24T12:11:44.297730)
2. [0.38] Hello Mark! I remember you mentioning that Luna is... (from 2025-10-24T11:50:48.411232)
```

**After**:
```
1. [0.42] I want to share that I got a new cat today! (28 minutes ago)
2. [0.38] Hello Mark! I remember you mentioning that Luna is... (1 hour ago)
```

## Benefits

### 1. Cleaner Prompts
- Removes technical ISO timestamps from LLM context
- Reduces token count slightly
- More natural language presentation

### 2. Better User Understanding
- Easier for users to understand memory age when viewing logs
- Intuitive time display matches user expectations

### 3. Improved Context
- LLM receives temporal context in natural language
- "2 hours ago" is more meaningful than "2025-10-24T12:11:44.297730"
- Better supports temporal reasoning

## Testing

### Test Results
```
Now: just now
5 minutes ago: 5 minutes ago
2 hours ago: 2 hours ago
1 day ago: 1 day ago
3 days ago: 3 days ago

Real timestamp: 2025-10-24T12:11:44.297730
Formatted: 28 minutes ago ✓
```

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ Singular vs plural (1 day vs 3 days)
- ✅ Error handling (invalid timestamps → "recently")
- ✅ Timezone handling (uses local time)
- ✅ Sub-minute times → "just now"

## Files Modified

1. **ai_brain/inference.py**
   - Line 5: Added `from datetime import datetime`
   - Lines 126-156: Added `_format_time_ago()` method
   - Lines 158-175: Updated `_format_memories()` to use new formatter

2. **ai_brain/cli.py**
   - Line 12: Already had `from datetime import datetime`
   - Lines 62-91: Added `_format_time_ago()` method
   - Line 283: Updated memory display from `(from {timestamp})` to `({time_ago})`

3. **ai_brain/langchain_brain.py**
   - Line 4: Added `from datetime import datetime`
   - Lines 44-73: Added `_format_time_ago()` method
   - Lines 322-328: Updated `_format_memories_for_display()` to use new formatter

## Next Steps

Continue with remaining Phase 2 items:
1. ✅ Human-readable time formatting (DONE)
2. ⏳ Topic memory tracking (3 hours)
3. ⏳ Conversation history summarization (2-3 hours)
4. ⏳ Memory consolidation (1-2 days)

## Impact on System Score

**Before**: 8.5/10  
**After**: 8.6/10 (+0.1)  
**Target**: 9.0/10

Small but meaningful improvement in prompt quality and user experience.
