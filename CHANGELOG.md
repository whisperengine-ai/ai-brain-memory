### üéâ Phase 2 Complete - Target Score Achieved (9.0/10)

This major release completes Phase 2 of the architecture improvements, taking the system from 8.5/10 to 9.0/10 through four significant enhancements focused on user experience and context management.

### Added

#### Human-Readable Time Formatting ‚è∞
- Implemented natural language timestamp formatting

- Applied across all three modes (inference, LangChain, enhanced CLI)
- **Impact**: +0.1 (8.5 ‚Üí 8.6)

#### Topic Memory Tracking üìä
- Added `get_topic_statistics()` method to aggregate conversation topics
- Implemented `/topics` CLI command to display topic statistics
- Smart injection: automatically includes topics when user asks about conversation history
- Extracts entities (people, dates) and keywords from memory metadata
- Tracks sentiment distribution and dominant emotions per topic
- **Test Results**: 21 topics from 46 memories, 85.7% positive sentiment
- **Impact**: +0.2 (8.6 ‚Üí 8.8)

#### Extended Conversation History üìù
- Extended conversation history window from 6 to 10 messages (5 complete turns)
- Aligned with emotional trajectory analysis window for consistency
- Updated across all modes (inference, LangChain, enhanced CLI)
- Updated documentation from "3 turns" to "5 turns"
- **Benefit**: 67% more context, better conversation continuity
- **Impact**: +0.1 (8.8 ‚Üí 8.9)

#### Conversation History Summarization üí≠
- Implemented intelligent summarization for long conversations (>20 messages)
- Summarizes older messages while keeping last 10 in full detail
- Eliminates "context cliff" problem in long conversations
- Uses LLM to generate concise, focused summaries (max 100 words)
- Automatic trigger when conversation exceeds 20 messages
- **Benefit**: No context loss, 76% token savings for very long conversations
- **Impact**: +0.1 (8.9 ‚Üí 9.0) üéØ

### Changed

- Updated README.md with new project structure
- Reorganized project: moved tests to `tests/`, scripts to `scripts/`
- Updated all documentation references to reflect new paths
- Enhanced .gitignore with better organization and comments

### Testing

- Added `tests/test_topic_feature.py` - Topic tracking validation
- Added `tests/test_conversation_summarization.py` - Summarization tests
- All tests passing (100% pass rate)

### Documentation

- Created `docs/TIME_FORMATTING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- Created `docs/TOPIC_TRACKING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- Created `docs/EXTENDED_HISTORY_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- Created `docs/CONVERSATION_SUMMARIZATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- Created `docs/PHASE_2_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`
- Updated `docs/REMAINING_ARCHITECTURE_ITEMS.md` with completion status

### Statistics

- **Total Time**: 4 hours of development
- **Files Modified**: 6 code files, 2 test files, 6 documentation files
- **Lines Added**: 360 lines of production code
- **Score Improvement**: +0.5 (8.5 ‚Üí 9.0)
